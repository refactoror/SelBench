Like the Selenium IDE addon itself,
`selbench-fx.xpi` is a zip archive containing various .js files.
The SelBench `user-extensions.js` file
is a combination of .js files drawn from the .xpi file.
See: https://github.com/refactoror/SelBench/tree/master/selbench-fx-xpi/chrome/content/extensions
The .js files are concatenated in the order specified by extension-loader.xul,
plus the user-extensions-base.js file:
https://github.com/refactoror/SelBench/tree/master/build/user-extensions-base.js,
(which is inserted just before selbench.js).

When Selenium Server loads user-extensions.js, `$$.seleniumEnv` is set to `"server"`,
and a `testCase` object is created that simulates the object by the same name in Selenium IDE.
SelBench then operates just like it does in Selenium IDE.
