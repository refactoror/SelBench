=SelBench 1.1=

Installer: https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/selenium-ide-selbench/

=Description=

Provides utilities for testing, validating, and benchmarking Selenium IDE scripts. This is especially useful for instrumenting scripts that are used to test Selenium IDE extensions.

=Features=

* Convenience functions: <tt>$w()</tt> and <tt>$d()</tt> are shorthand references to the window and document objects of the target webpage
* Commands: <tt>alert</tt>, <tt>log</tt>, <tt>clearLog</tt>,
    <tt>deleteVars</tt>,
    <tt>expectError</tt>, <tt>emit</tt>, <tt>assertEmitted</tt>, <tt>resetEmitted</tt>,
    <tt>startTimer</tt>, <tt>timerElapsed</tt>

=Examples of Use=

Object access:

 assertEval|$d().title === $w().document.title

Simple logging and prompting:

 alert|"hello world"
 log|"hello world"
 clearLog

Undefining Selenium variables:

 deleteVars|a,b,c

Verifying that a command will fail as expected:

 expectError|"n is not define"
 getEval|n

Tracking state and sequence,("$" + "{n}~" prevents variable substitution):

 resetEmitted
 deleteVar|n
 emit|"${n}"
 store|0|n
 emit|n++
 emit|"${n}"
 assertEmitted|"$" + "{n}~" + 0 + "~" + 1

Timing script execution:

 startTimer
 timerElapsed

<tt>$w()</tt> and <tt>$d()</tt> can be used in expressions:

 assertEval|$d().title === $w().document.title|true

=Selenium Server=

Selenese scripts that use SelBench commands can also be run in Selenium Server
via the <tt>-user-extensions</tt> and <tt>-htmlSuite</tt> options.
Get the current <tt>user-extensions.js</tt> here:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/refactoror/SelBench/master/user-extensions.js

For more information on running Selenium Server,
see: http://www.seleniumhq.org/docs/08_user_extensions.jsp#using-user-extensions-with-selenium-ide

Note that prior to version 1.1 SelBench has been a Firefox extension only,
whereas Selenium Server can target a wide range of browsers.
SelBench currently passes its full regression test suite when run against:
* <tt>firefox</tt> (31.4)
* <tt>googlechrome</tt> (40.0)
* <tt>opera</tt> (27.0)
Community help is welcome and encouraged in expanding this list.
There are currently known issues with:
* <tt>iexplorer</tt> (11.0): <tt>Object.defineProperties</tt> fails - test-startup hangs
* <tt>safari</tt> (5.1.7): <tt>htmlTestRunner</tt> is not defined - test-startup hangs

Running scripts in Selenium Server introduces the possibilty of browser compatibility issues,
especially when running IDE-produced scripts against non-Firefox browsers.
Potential pain points include differences in
JavaScript error messaging, (e.g., <tt>try</tt>/<tt>catch</tt>),
and DOM property values, (e.g., <tt>$w().title</tt>).

When reporting an issue, be sure to provide very specific browser/OS info,
as well as the faling test case, test html, and error log.
Better yet, if you can fix the problem, submit a github pull request
-- which is how server support came about in the first place.

=Limitations=

The <tt>expectError</tt> command operates on the next command to be executed.
But it cannot be used on:
* Commands that cannot fail, (e.g., <tt>startTimer</tt>, the SelBlocks <tt>exitTest</tt> command)
* Commands that themselves manage other commands, (e.g., itself, the SelBlocks <tt>try</tt> command)

Never use the ...<tt>AndWait</tt> counterpart of a SelBench command, e.g., <tt>logAndWait</tt>.
(''Selenium automatically registers one with every defined command, even though it does not always make sense.'')
If you use one of these, (usually via inadvertent auto-completion),
SelBench will throw an error when you try to start the script in the IDE.
This is a bit more difficult to diagnose in Selenium Server,
which cannot currently detect the situation,
and therefore simply hangs without an error when such a command executes.

=Troubleshooting=

==Selenium Server==

===Testsuite works in the IDE, but won't start in Server===

* You haven't provided the SelBench user-extensions.js on the command line.

===Test hangs at SelBench command===

* You may have used the <tt>AndWait</tt> counterpart command. This is never valid because SelBench commands do not interact with webpages.
